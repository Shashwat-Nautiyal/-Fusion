# 🔁 Fusion+ Cross-Chain Escrow Swaps (Base Sepolia ↔ Etherlink)

🚀 A minimal proof-of-concept for atomic, trustless swaps across different testnets using escrows and the 1inch cross-chain SDK.

 This project enables token swaps between Base Sepolia and Etherlink testnets without relying on a single bridging mechanism or external sequencers. Swaps are settled using smart contract escrows, secured by hashlocks and timelocks, and executed using the 1inch SDK.

## ✨ Features

- ⛓️ Trustless swaps between Base Sepolia & Etherlink testnets
- 🔐 Escrow contracts on both chains with onchain hashlock + timelock settlement
- ⚡ Uses 1inch cross-chain SDK for order routing and relayer abstraction
- 🧪 Complete end-to-end test suite for swap flows across both chains

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Maker creates an order** specifying:
   - Source chain, destination chain
   - Token & amount offered
   - Token & amount expected in return

2. **Taker accepts the order** using a shared secret, generating a hashlock.

3. The system:
   - 🏗 Deploys source & destination escrows via factory contracts
   - ⛓ Locks funds with hashlock & timelock
   - ✅ On destination chain, taker claims tokens by revealing the secret
   - 🔁 On source chain, maker uses the revealed secret to claim the counter tokens

4. If timeout expires, escrows can be reclaimed by their creators using the timelock mechanism.

## 🛠️ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fusion-plus-crosschain-escrow.git
cd fusion-plus-crosschain-escrow
pnpm install
```
Set up your environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
 Then edit .env with your RPC URLs, private key, and factory addresses
## 🔐 .env Configuration
Create a .env file with the following:

```env
BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC=https://...
ETHERLINK_RPC=https://...
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
ESCROW_FACTORY_BASE=0xabcSRC...
ESCROW_FACTORY_ETHERLINK=0xabcDST...
## 🧪 Run Tests
Run all cross-chain tests with:

```bash
pnpm test
```
You can also run individual test files (e.g. main.spec.ts).

📦 Build Contracts
Compile contracts using:

```bash
forge build
```
## 📎 Notes
The factories for Base Sepolia and Etherlink have different addresses. The tests and deployment logic respect this and fetch addresses from the .env file.

Escrow implementation contracts (SRC and DST) are deployed and referenced via the factory.

## 🏁 Status
✅ Working prototype for hashlock-based swaps across Base Sepolia and Etherlink testnets using separate escrow contracts and the 1inch cross-chain SDK.
